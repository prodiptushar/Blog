** Freedom
1. Being discipline is the key to freedom.

** Hard Work
1. hard work does not mean
   you going to school regularly, or doing homework or not watching cartoon in the television,
   That's the work everyone is doing . Hard work means after coming from school without opening up your phone you open your book and give a mock test.
   when everyone is using social media you are going through previous year questions, when everyone is watching anime you are making notes and revision material for your upcoming exam .

** Truth
1. Most of the time people take advantage of you saying you are better then them in something.
2. Better not reading a book , Than trusting a book completely.
