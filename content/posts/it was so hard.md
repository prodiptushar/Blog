So after a long and hard try and error i finally managed to deploy my site in netlify.
let me tell you the steps one by one 

# Process
    1. First open up the doc about setting up hugo site with netlify that have been provided by hugo in their own website . create the netlify.toml file
    2. Then add the theme in the theme folder and change the config.yml accordingly
    3. then push them to github and then connect to netlify.

## It seemed so easy 
    But as dumb witted i am It took me days before i could use this powerful theme.
